        <h3>Summary/Objective</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>A summary statement is 2–3 sentences that provides a brief synopsis of your work experience and skills. You might use this if you have quite a few years of experience. An objective, on the other hand, is a focused 2–3-sentence statement that demonstrates your interest and candidacy for the position you hope to land. You might use an objective if you're changing careers, a student or entry-level candidate, or if you're going to take the time to write a compelling, custom objective.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Focus on your contributions, not your responsibilities. For example, “Grew digital marketing ROI by 14%” is much better than saying, “Led digital marketing efforts.”</li>
            <li>Start your job description bullet points with active verbs rather than personal pronouns. For instance, “Designed and implemented work ticketing system” propels your content forward while “I designed and implemented work ticketing system” slows the recruiter.</li>
            <li>Quantify your impact whenever possible because numbers corroborate your claims. Stating that you “Uncovered $3.2M in potential savings” shows a real result over a generic claim of “Discovered potential savings.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="company">Company Name | Location | 20XX – 20XX</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your bullet point descriptions at three lines or less. “Created nutrition and personal training plans for 30+ clients, helping them lose 26 pounds on average” is more compelling than a run-on, redundancies, or wordiness.</li>
            <li>Write your job descriptions in the past tense, though you can write current experience in the present tense if you wish. “Partnered with cross-functional teams to design multimedia campaigns that boosted subscriptions by 17%” will make a lot more sense to a recruiter when you left that role three years ago.</li>
